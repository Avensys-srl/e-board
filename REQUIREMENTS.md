EBOARD Manager - Functional Requirements (Updated)
=================================================

1. Purpose
----------
EBOARD Manager is a project-centric platform for structured management of
electronics design projects (boards, firmware, accessories, subsystems).
It centralizes technical, documentary, and decision data, supports approvals,
and ensures traceability across the full project lifecycle.

2. Scope
--------
The system manages:
- electronic boards (PCB, PCBA)
- firmware and software versions
- accessories and mechatronic parts
- project variants
- suppliers and subcontractors
- tests, validations, approvals
- technical and decision history

3. Tech Stack (baseline)
------------------------
- Backend: PHP 7.2.11 compatible (procedural, no framework required)
- Database: MySQL
- Environment: XAMPP
- Frontend: custom HTML/CSS (Bootstrap optional)
- React optional for dashboards only (not required)

4. Core concept: Project as a structured object
-----------------------------------------------
Each project includes:
- unique identity
- current state and state history
- involved actors and assignments
- documents and submissions
- approvals and decisions
- technical versions (HW/FW)

Projects evolve dynamically: workflow is generated by decisions and enforced
constraints, not by a fixed predefined flow.

5. Roles and permissions
------------------------
Roles include:
- Electronics Designer
- Firmware Developer
- Supplier
- Test/Validation Lead
- Project Coordinator
- Admin

Rules:
- Admin can do everything and assign phases to others.
- Users see and act on phases assigned to them or matching their role.
- Role-based notifications are required.

6. Dashboard
------------
Each user has a dashboard that shows:
- assigned phases
- pending approvals
- required actions and alerts
- recent notifications

7. State machine (project-level)
--------------------------------
Projects move through formal states (Draft, Submitted, Under Review, etc.).
Transitions are explicit actions, role-bound, logged in history, and notify
relevant roles.

8. Phase workflow
-----------------
Phases belong to a project and have:
- owner role
- optional assignee
- due date
- completion status
- required documents (when applicable)

Phase submission requires required documents to be uploaded first.

9. Document management (project-based)
--------------------------------------
Documents can be attached at:
- project level
- phase level
- version level

File manager must be project-based and include a Trash:
- soft delete moves file to trash
- files are never auto-deleted
- only Admin can permanently delete

10. Document types and requirements
-----------------------------------
Document types are managed by Admin (standard list).
Each project type can define required document types.
Rules:
- Project type can be edited/renamed by Admin.
- Project type can be deleted only if not used by any project.
- Required documents for a type cannot be removed if the type is in use.

11. Versioning
--------------
Internal versioning is required:
- project_versions (label, parent, description, created_by, is_current)
- firmware_versions (label, description, checksum)
Documents can be linked to versions for traceability.

12. Traceability
----------------
System must track:
- who did what and when
- which documents support decisions
- approval history and state transitions

13. Exclusions
--------------
Do NOT implement electronics logic or real-life examples as software rules.
Examples are illustrative only.

14. Goal
--------
Provide a clean, extensible project management platform with enforced
constraints, approvals, and full traceability.
